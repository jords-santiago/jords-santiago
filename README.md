In a world full of whys, say "why not?". In a world full of "can't", say "can do". In a world full of problems, we might as well solve them. 

I took a break as my previous company closed for business during the COVID-19 global pandemic.  

Now, I am looking for opportunities in Research and Development as I have been since my college days. I am very much interested in new challenges with regards to Data Science as I have been doing during my break. I am still into Software Engineering as I have done throughout my professional life.

Up until its closure, I worked as Software Engineer at Nokia Manila Technology Center with a position of Senior Specialist. I maintained a test tool software implemented in C used for performance testing of Nokia's controller products. I also had a role of Fault Coordinator where I monitored bugs reported against the software.

Before that, I was previously a Senior Hardware Engineer at Canon Information Technologies Philippines, Inc. where I worked as a Design Verification Engineer. I had experience as a Configuration Management Lead, Quality Assurance Lead and Technical Lead in the various projects that I have been a part of in Canon.

I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the University of the Philippines. The education and experience I had there got me started in problem solving and critical/creative thinking, skills that I still use to this day.
