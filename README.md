I was previously a Big Data Engineer for DFI Retail Group office in the Philippines.  I performed data modeling, development, maintenance and support of the company's data analytics platform mainly implemented in Microsoft Azure products such as Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

Up until its closure, I worked as Software Engineer at Nokia Manila Technology Center with a position of Senior Specialist. I maintained a test tool software implemented in C used for performance testing of Nokia's controller products. I also had a role of Fault Coordinator where I monitored bugs reported against the software.

Before that, I was previously a Senior Hardware Engineer at Canon Information Technologies Philippines, Inc. where I worked as a Design Verification Engineer. I had experience as a Configuration Management Lead, Quality Assurance Lead and Technical Lead in the various projects that I have been a part of in Canon.

I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the University of the Philippines. The education and experience I had there got me started in problem solving and critical/creative thinking, skills that I still use to this day.
